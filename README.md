# Hyperapp built with Parcel

Something like the [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) basic example, with the project built with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Run

- Install dependencies with `npm i` (or `npm install`) (created with npm v5.6.0).
- Run Parcel dev server with `npx parcel src/index.html`.
